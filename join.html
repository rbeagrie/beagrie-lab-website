	      <p>Applications to study for a DPhil (Oxford University&apos;s
	      equivalent of a PhD) on the Nuffield Department of
	      Medicine&apos;s <a
	      href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/study/about-the-dphil">DPhil in
	      Clinical Medicine</a> course are now open for students
              wishing to start their course in October 2024! Projects
	      are normally developed together with prospective applicants, so <a
	      href="mailto:robert.beagrie@well.ox.ac.uk">get in touch with Rob</a> if
	      you&apos;re interested and we can discuss possible projects.</p>

	      <p>Deadline for applications: December 1st 2023</p>

	      <h4>Molecular basis of neurodevelopmental issues in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome</h4>

	      <p>DNA loops allow enhancers to contact and activate their target
	      genes in the 3D space of the nucleus. These loops are formed and
	      stabilised by CTCF (a zinc-finger transcription factor) and
	      cohesin (a ring-shaped multi-protein complex). Mutations in
	      components of the cohesin complex cause a rare genetic disease
	      called Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) which affects between 1
	      in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 individuals. CdLS patients exhibit
	      varying degrees of intellectual disability, microcephaly and
	      social anxiety. This project aims to understand the molecular
	      mechanisms linking disrupted DNA loop formation with brain
	      development. </p>

	      <p>Our lab works with mice that carry a conditional knockout
	      Nipbl allele, as heterozygous loss of function mutations in NIPBL
	      are the most common cause of CdLS. These mice also exhibit
	      cerebellar hypoplasia and altered gene expression in the brain.
	      This project would involve identifying the specific neuronal cell
	      types and genes that are disrupted when embryos are deficient for
	      Nipbl. The student would address this question by generating and
	      analysing multiple genomics datasets from Nipbl knockout mouse
	      embryos and their wild-type littermates. These could include
	      single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, spatial
	      transcriptomics, CUT&amp;TAG and Genome Architecture Mapping.</p>

	      <p>The project would not require the student to undertake any
	      animal work themselves. The project will require a mix of both
	      wet-lab and dry lab work but the specific balance between the two
	      can be adjusted in either direction depending on the preferences
	      of the student.</p>

	      <h4>Investigating the role of genetic mosaisicm in congenital disease</h4>

	      <p>Genetic diseases are usually caused by mutations that are
	      either inherited from a parent or occur de novo in the parental
	      germline. In both cases all the cells in the affected child will
	      carry the causative mutation. However, in some cases pathogenic
	      mutations occur after fertilisation - during early development of
	      the embryo - and in this case, only a proportion of an
	      individualâ€™s cells carry the mutation, a phenomenon known as
	      mosaicism. With improved sequencing technologies, it has become
	      apparent that mosaicism is not as rare as previously thought.
	      Moreover, there are conditions which are much more frequently
	      caused by mosaic mutations. For example, up to 20% of cases of
	      Cornelia de Lange Syndrome are caused by mosaic mutations and the
	      pathogenic mutation is almost always missing from blood cells.
	      Similarly, focal cortical dysplasia, a common cause of epilepsy,
	      is commonly associated with mosaic mutations.</p>

	      <p>In this DPhil project, you will work with the Beagrie lab
	      (based at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics) and the Goriely
	      lab (based at the MRC Weatherall Institute for Molecular
	      Medicine) to study how mosaic mutations affect development and
	      cause disease. Specifically, you will use conditional inducible
	      mouse models to study how cells bearing mutations in known
	      disease genes expand and compete with their wild-type
	      counterparts in different tissues.</p>

	      <h3>DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics</h3>

	      <p>Applications to study for a DPhil (Oxford University&apos;s
	      equivalent of a PhD) on the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics <a
	      href="https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/study/gms">DPhil in
	      Genomic Medicine and Statistics</a> are now open for students wishing to start
	      their studies in October 2024. <a
	      href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics">Please
	      apply here</a> - applications are open until December 1st 2023. The first year of the GMS
	      course will involve short rotations in 2-3 different laboratories, so you don't need to
	      identify a project before you apply. However, if you would like to talk about research topics
	      available in the lab please <a
	      href="mailto:robert.beagrie@well.ox.ac.uk">get in touch with Rob</a>.</p>

	      <h3>Masters Students</h3>

	      <p>Projects are available for Masters or rotation students
	      wanting to start in Spring 2023.  please <a
	      href="mailto:robert.beagrie@well.ox.ac.uk">contact Rob</a> for
	      further details.</p>
