	      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	      
	      <p>This document is intended to set out the expectations and ways of
	      working in the Beagrie lab both for current lab members and for
	      people thinking about joining the group. It was written by Rob,
	      based on discussions with the whole lab, and is reviewed and
	      updated annually.</p>

	      <h3>Mission statement</h3>

	      <p>The goal of the Beagrie lab is to understand how disruption of
	      chromatin organisation contributes to human disease. We achieve
	      this goal by conducting rigorous and well-controlled experiments,
	      using models that are appropriate to the disease processes in
	      question. Whilst we don’t conduct translational research, we
	      still prioritise basic research that has the potential to benefit
	      patients (even if that potential may take a long time to come
	      about). We hold ourselves to a high standard of research
	      integrity, and try to minimise the negative impacts of our
	      research on the environment.</p>

	      <h3>My expectations for you:</h3>

	      <p>I do not expect expect lab members to work more than their
	      contracted hours (37.5 hours per week for full-time staff). I do
	      expect full time staff to be in the Centre during our core hours
	      (10am to 4pm) on most days. You do not need permission to work
	      from home occasionally, if you need to work from home on a
	      regular schedule this should be discussed but is usually
	      possible. You are not expected to work late evenings or on
	      weekends unless there are unavoidable experimental constraints
	      (e.g. a time course). If you frequently find yourself working for
	      more than eight hours per day please let me know so we can talk
	      through any issues and try to find an appropriate solution.</p>

	      <p>I expect you to make the safety of yourself and your labmates
	      your top priority when you are working in the lab. You must make
	      sure you have read, understood and signed the relevant risk
	      assessments or COSHH forms for any experiments you might be
	      doing. Please let me know if there is anything written in a risk
	      assessment that you don’t understand or if there is no risk
	      assessment for a protocol you are planning to use.</p>

	      <p>I expect you to be proactive in expanding your scientific
	      knowledge. This means keeping an eye out for new papers or
	      conferences relevant to your project (please ask if you need help
	      with this) and attending seminars. DPhil students and RAs should
	      aim to attend four seminars per month, postdocs should be aiming
	      to attend at least two. Conference attendance is always dependent
	      on available funding, but in general DPhil students and postdocs
	      should expect to attend one meeting in the UK per year. Postdocs
	      should normally attend an international meeting every two years,
	      and DPhil students one international meeting in their third or
	      fourth year. Lab members are expected to consider sustainability
	      when planning to attend meetings, especially for international
	      conferences.</p>

	      <p>Lab meetings last for one hour and each lab member will
	      present around three times per year. The presenter will usually
	      prepare a presentation covering their recent experiments
	      which should last for around 30-40 minutes, in order to leave
	      plenty of time for discussion in our one-hour slot. We also like
	      to start lab meeting presentations with a “minute for me”: one
	      minute in which you tell us about something completely unrelated
	      to science, e.g. a recent holiday, a book you enjoyed. This just
	      helps us get to know each other better!</p>

	      <p>I expect you to keep good records of your experimental and
	      computational work.  All experiments should be recorded in
	      labarchives and should include an aim, a full protocol, results
	      (including raw data) and a conclusion. Mistakes happen and are a
	      normal part of lab life, the most important thing is to always
	      record them in your lab book. All computational scripts should be
	      kept on github and should be clearly documented, your files and
	      projects should be sensibly organised with a consistent naming
	      format. Next generation sequencing data should be backed up and
	      should be uploaded to GEO for long-term storage once we are happy
	      that it is of publication quality. We will discuss exactly when
	      datasets are made public, but as I am a fan of open science I
	      will usually be in favour of making data public earlier rather
	      than later.</p>

	      <h3>You can expect from me:</h3>

	      <p>Core DPhil students and postdocs can expect to meet with me
	      one-on-one around once per week. These meetings are informal so
	      do not prepare a presentation, but please do make sure that you
	      have recent data you would like to discuss to hand and in an
	      easily understandable format (your electronic lab notebook is
	      fine). We will try to hold these meetings in person where
	      possible. The number of meetings I have with co-supervised DPhil
	      students will vary for each student, but you should have a clear
	      understanding of how often we will meet at the beginning of your
	      project and you can always ask me if you think we should change
	      the frequency of your meetings. Masters students,
	      undergraduate/summer students and research assistants will have
	      an assigned day-to-day supervisor who they can expect to meet
	      once a week, which will either be me, a postdoc or a senior DPhil
	      student.</p>

	      <p>You can expect to understand how the work you are doing is likely
	      to contribute to an eventual publication, and have an idea of
	      where you are likely to appear in the author list for that
	      publication. DPhil students and postdocs will have a clearly
	      defined main project that will lead to a first-author paper. We
	      will have conversations about authorship when we start a new
	      project but contributions can change over time so it is important
	      to regularly check in about our expectations. If you are ever
	      uncertain about how your contributions to a particular project
	      will be recognised, please make sure to raise your concerns with
	      me.</p>

	      <p>Every lab member can expect focussed support from me on their
	      career development. We will meet once a year to discuss your
	      progress, set some goals for the year ahead, talk through your
	      career plans and identify any areas in which you may need
	      additional support or training. I’m also happy to talk about your
	      career any time outside of our annual meetings. I am usually
	      happy to provide a letter of recommendation or a reference for
	      anyone who needs one.  Please give me as much notice as possible
	      and include the details of the position and why you want to
	      apply, the application deadline and the way the reference needs
	      to be submitted.</p>

	      <h3>Wellness policy</h3>

	      <p>If you feel at all unwell, for any reason, make sure to take time
	      to rest up and get better. Let someone in the lab know that you
	      won’t be coming in (so that we don’t worry about you) but you do
	      not need to explain why. If you need some extra help to keep an
	      experiment running whilst you are off, just ask. If you need to
	      restructure your work because of your health (e.g. chronic health
	      issues, recurring medical appointments, pregnancy, allergies) let
	      me know and we can figure out a plan that works for you. The same
	      applies if you have caring commitments, we will discuss together
	      to make a plan that works for everyone involved. Finally, take
	      regular breaks! Make sure you get up and walk around if you have
	      been working at a computer or a microscope. Don’t forget to
	      schedule yourself a lunch break! Your brain needs food and
	      regular breaks to work best, and to avoid making mistakes.</p>
